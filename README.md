# **Section 1: Project Overview**  
The earlier version of ValueFrenzy project primarily focused on data analysisâ€”uncovering sales trends, transaction patterns, and pricing inefficiencies. But business decisions arenâ€™t just about data; they require strategic alignment, stakeholder insights, and business context. Thatâ€™s why I enhanced this projectâ€”integrating Business Analysis (BA) techniques to drive actionable solutions. This project presents a business analysis of ValueFrenzy, a fictional supermarket chain across the USA, Mexico, and Canada. 

The analysis aims to diagnose critical business challenges, particularly declining revenue and profitability in the USA, while exploring key performance metricsâ€”Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value (ATV). The projectâ€™s core objective is to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations that enhance ValueFrenzy's market positioning, operational efficiency, and customer engagement.

Using historical sales data from 2021 to 2023, the analysis identifies regional trends, product performance, and customer behavior to help ValueFrenzy make data-driven business decisions. By addressing key issues such as profitability erosion, shifts in consumer demand, and regional performance disparities, this project enables ValueFrenzy to refine its business strategy for sustainable growth.

# **Section 2: Motivation**  
The Retail and Consumer Goods industry operates in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market environment. Supermarkets like ValueFrenzy face challenges such as changing customer preferences, fluctuating costs, and competitive pricing pressures. This project was motivated by the need to:

âœ… Understand why ValueFrenzy is experiencing a decline in revenue and profitability in the USA.

âœ… Identify trends in customer spending habits across different regions and product categories.

âœ… Provide data-backed recommendations to improve operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

âœ… Support strategic decision-making through business-driven insights rather than purely numerical analysis.


# **Section 3: Data Sources**
The analysis is based on historical sales data from 2021-2023, available in CSV format. The data includes sales transactions, product categories, and regional performance metrics. To prepare the data for analysis:

âœ… Power Query was used for data cleaning and transformation.

âœ… Power Pivot was utilized to establish relationships between sales data (fact table) and relevant business dimensions (products, regions, and time).

âœ… No SQL queries were required, as all transformations were performed within Excelâ€™s ecosystem.

# **Section 4: Key KPIs**

## **Total Revenue**
âœ” Measures the overall income generated across all regions (USA, Mexico, and Canada) and product categories.

âœ” Purpose: To evaluate regional revenue contributions, identify trends, and assess the impact of strategic decisions on overall income.

## **Gross Profit**
âœ” Calculated as Total Revenue minus the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

âœ” Purpose: To provide insights into the profitability of products and regions, guiding decisions on cost management and margin optimization.

## **Quantity Sold**
âœ” Represents the total units sold across all regions and product tiers (low, medium, and high).

âœ” Purpose: To analyze product performance, demand trends, and the effectiveness of sales strategies.

## **Total Transactions**
âœ” The total number of customer transactions processed across all regions.

âœ” Purpose: To understand customer activity and engagement levels, and their impact on revenue generation.

## **Average Transaction Value (ATV)**
âœ” The average value of a single transaction, calculated as Total Revenue divided by Total Transactions.

âœ” Purpose: To gauge customer spending behavior, identify opportunities for upselling, and align pricing strategies with market demand.

# **Section 7: Business Insights and Recommendations**
## **1. Revenue and Profitability Trends**

âœ” ***Observation***: The USA, which accounts for 51% of total revenue, has seen a significant decline in revenue and gross profit since late 2021.

âœ” **Key Drivers**: Lower customer spending, changes in product mix, and reduced transaction volume.

âœ” **Recommendation**: Implement targeted promotions, optimize product pricing, and reassess high-cost SKUs to improve margins.

## **2. Regional Performance Comparison**

âœ” **Observation**: While the USA has struggled, Mexico has maintained relatively stable revenue, and Canada, despite lower total sales, has the highest Average Transaction Value (ATV).

âœ” **Recommendation**: Leverage successful pricing and product bundling strategies from Mexico and Canada to address performance gaps in the USA.

## **3. Product Category Insights**

âœ” **Observation**: High-tier electronics contribute the most to revenue but have fluctuating demand, while low-tier groceries drive consistent sales volume.

âœ” **Recommendation**: Focus on demand forecasting to ensure optimal inventory levels and pricing adjustments for high-value products.

## **4. Customer Behavior & Transactions**

âœ” **Observation**: Transaction volume increased in late 2021 but did not translate into higher ATV, suggesting discount-driven sales.

âœ” **Recommendation**: Introduce loyalty programs and targeted upselling strategies to improve customer retention and increase per-transaction spending.
